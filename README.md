# HJAELPCOIN

HJAELP is a next generation service marketplace currently in development. It is
designed to be a place where people can find service providers to help with
whatever they need, and where service providers of all types can find a steady flow
of new jobs. Its main improvements over current labor marketplaces will be its
better usability, treatment of service providers, quality of service providers, and
discovery features. HJAELPCOIN is a new utility token that will underpin this
marketplace. HJAELPCOIN will primarily have two functions within the future HJAELP
marketplace: It will be used as a means of payment between users on the one
hand, and as a way to incentivize certain user behaviors on the other. Built on the
Binance Smart Chain (BSC), HJAELPCOIN will allow future users of the HJAELP
platform to redeem their HJAELPCOIN for early access and special discounts on
services they buy through the HJAELP platform. After HJAELPCOIN is fully integrated
into the HJAELP platform, it will also be awarded to users who complete certain
actions inside the HJAELP platform in order to incentivize behaviors accruing to the
good of all HJAELP platform participants. Upon HJAELPCOINâ€™s launch, the HJAELP
team will retain custody of 4% of initial token supply in the Service Economy Wallet.
Pending future development, HJAELPCOIN holders may also have rights to propose
and vote on proposals for use of the Service Economy Wallet funds, mediated by
the HJAELP team. HJAELPCOIN will enable the HJAELP platform to transcend barriers
that currently stop existing service marketplaces from providing even more
efficiencies and value to users. Using the tools of decentralized finance, the
HJAELPCOIN team plans to improve the service economy for everyone.
